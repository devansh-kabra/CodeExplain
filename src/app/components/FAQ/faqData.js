        "Q": "Why is code explanation an essential skill for developers?",
        "A": `Because writing code solves the problem but explaining it proves you truly understand it. 
            Teams trust developers who can communicate clearly, justify decisions, and think structurally.`,
    },
    {
        "key": 1,
        "Q": "Why do interviewers focus more on explanation than just the solution?",
        "A": `Anyone can write code. Few can explain it well.\n
                Interviewers use explanations to judge your thought process, clarity, and communication
                which often matter more than a perfect answer.`,
    },
    {
        "key": 2,
        "Q": "How does CodeExplain train me to think like an interviewer?",
        "A": `It shapes your explanation the same way interviewers evaluate candidates i.e. with 
                clear steps, strong decisions, and confident reasoning. You start thinking and speaking like someone who's already in the room.`,
    },
    {
        "key": 3,
        "Q": "What's the right way to use CodeExplain while practicing coding problems?",
        "A": `Solve the problem → paste your code → get a clean, structured explanation → learn what you missed → improve quickly.\n
                It's the fastest way to build interview ready habits.`,
    },
    {
        "key": 4,
        "Q": "Is CodeExplain free, and will it stay free?",
        "A": "Yes. CodeExplain is made for students and learners, and the core features will remain completely free.",
